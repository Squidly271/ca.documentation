Community Applications is a plugin designed to make finding, installing, and managing docker and plugin applications.  When using this plugin, there is no longer any need to use the <em>Repositories</em> section of the Docker Tab

From top to bottom will explain all aspects of Community Applications starting from the basic and going to the more advanced options.

All items within this plugin have tooltips enabled to further guide you in operation.  For a help for the settings for this plugin, load the settings page and press Help.  Each item will have associated help text displayed.

After installation, a new tab will appear on unRaid's main menu called "Apps".  Additionally, there will be a section within the Settings tab called Community Applications which has some extra utilities to customize the operation of this plugin.
<hr>
To begin with, at the top of the page are the navigation buttons.  Clicking or hovering over these buttons will change the displayed results accordingly:<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/SectionIconNew.png' height='50px'> - This chooses which "section" to display (Available Apps, Installed Apps, Previously Installed Apps, Pinned Apps, additional CA Modules<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/ViewIconNew.png' height='50px'> - This chooses how to display the results<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/CategoryIconNew.png' height='50px'> - This selects a category of apps to display<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/SubCategoryIconNew.png' height='50px'> - When available, this selects a subcategory of apps to display<br>
<hr>
<font size="3" color="red"><p id='displayed'>Displayed Results</p></font>

After selecting a category (or searching),the applications will appear: (example from Icon Details Mode)
<br><br>
<img src='https://github.com/Squidly271/ca.documentation/raw/master/icondetails.png'><br>
<br>
Clicking or hovering over the icon will bring up more details about the application.<br><br>
<img src='https://github.com/Squidly271/ca.documentation/raw/master/popup.png'><br>
<br>
The following action icons may be available for any given application:<br>
<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/install.png' height='25px'><img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/edit.png' height='25px'><img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/update.png' height='25px'> - These icons respectively will <b>Install, Edit, or Update</b> an application<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/WebPage.png' height='25px'> - Clicking this icon will take you to an application's GUI<br>

<br>
<font size="3" color="red"><p id='searching'>Searching</p></font>
<br>
At the top right of the page is a search box.  Enter a search string here to search for either an application's name, author's name, repository name, or description<br><br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<font size='3' color='red'><p id='previous'>Installed / Previously Installed Applications</p></font>
<br>
Selecting Installed Apps from the "Section" icon will display all applications which are currently installed, and allow you to edit them.<br>
A <img src='https://github.com/limetech/webgui/raw/master/plugins/dynamix.docker.manager/images/remove.png' width='20px'></img> will appear next to the application.  Selecting this will allow you to uninstall the application, and optionally delete the appdata folder for the application (See <b>Settings</b> section)<br><br>
<br>
Selecting Previous Apps from the "Section" icon will display all applications which have been previously installed, and allow you to re-install them.<br>
A <img src='https://github.com/limetech/webgui/raw/master/plugins/dynamix.docker.manager/images/remove.png' width='20px'></img> will appear next to the application.  Selecting this will remove (ie: delete the user template) from the list of previously installed applications<br><br>
<hr>
<font size='3' color='red'><p id='pinned'>Pinning Applications</p></font>
<br>
On any of the displays (with the exception of when dockerHub search results are shown), you can "pin" an application for later viewing.  This is useful for when you're just skimming through the lists and come across an application that you'd like to try but don't have the time to do it right away.<br>
<br>
Pressing the <i class="ca_tooltip fa fa-thumb-tack tooltipstered" style='font-size:25px;color:red;padding:3px; -webkit-transform: rotate(20deg);-moz-transform: rotate(20deg);-ms-transform: rotate(20deg);-o-transform: rotate(20deg);transform: rotate(20deg);' aria-hidden="true"></i> will pin the application whereas pressing the <i class="ca_tooltip fa fa-thumb-tack tooltipstered" style='font-size:25px;color:green;padding:3px;' aria-hidden="true" title=""></i> will unpin the application.<br>
<br>
Pinned applications can be viewed by selecting Pinned Apps from the "Section" Icon<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<font size="3" color="red"><p id='dockerHub'>Advanced - dockerHub Integration</p></font>
<br>
<br>
There is a setting which you can enable which will allow you to search dockerHub for other applications beyond the ones which have had unRaid templates created for them.
<br>
When this option is enabled, a few more options are available.
<br>
<li>Clicking on the Application's Name of any application will then search dockerHub for that application.
<li>After performing any search for applications, a button will appear (<img src='https://github.com/Squidly271/community.applications/raw/master/source/community.applications/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/community.applications/images/docker.png' height=30px;>) to then allow you to search dockerHub for that application.
<br>
Within the dockerHub search results, you can navigate and search as before.  Clicking the author's name will search for all applications from that author.  Clicking the application's name will search for more results for that application name.
<br>
Clicking <input type='button' value='Add'> will attempt to create a template for that application and install it.  There are however some caveats with regards to the conversion process.  See this thread for more details: <a href='http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40262.msg401570#msg401570' target='_blank'>http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40262.msg401570#msg401570</a>
<br>
At a later time if you wish to manage the application added (Edit / restore to defaults, etc), the application will be available under the UNCATEGORIZED category.  (Alternatively, you could categorize the plugin by using the Docker Categorizer plugin <a href='http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40111.0'>HERE</a>
<br>
Depending upon what search term is currently being used, Community Applications may also offer you some alternate search terms for more relevant containers.
<br>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> When adding an application from dockerHub, popups must be enabled within your browser
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<font size="3" color="red"><p id='private'>Private Repositories</p></font>
<br>
If you have access to a so-called private repository (or wish to create your own), there are two options for integrating it into CA
<br>
Create a folder called <strong>/boot/config/plugins/community.applications/repositoryName</strong><br>
<br>
Within this folder, place any custom / private templates you might have.  (If using the dockerHub conversion section of this plugin, a folder will be automatically created here called <strong>dockerHub</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
The templates contained in the private repository will be flagged when displayed as <font color="red">Private</font>
<br>
<hr>
<font size="3" color="red"><p id='settings'>General Settings</p></font>
<br>
Within the apps tab, there is a link called "CA Settings" (top right). Clicking this link will allow you to fine tune the operation of the apps tab<br>
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Time to display applications as new / updated</b></font><br>
This option dictates the amount of time that a new or updated application will be flagged as new and displayed under the <strong>New / Updated</strong> category.  Defaults to 3 Months
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Favourite Repository</b></font><br>
This option allows you to set a "favourite" repository.  If set, then applications from that repository will display before all others.  Defaults to None
<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Show already installed apps within available apps</b></font><br>
By default, if an application has been installed, it will not appear within the available apps  (It will only show within Installed Apps).  Selected this will display the installed apps within the available apps lists
<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Hide Deprecated Applications</b></font><br>
By default, CA will not display any deprecated applications within the available apps.  It will always however show you any apps that have been deprecated within the Installed or Previous Apps sections.  As a general rule, it is not recommended to install deprecated applications onto your server
<font color="purple"><b>Hide Incompatible Applications</b></font><br>
If CA thinks that an application is incompatible with the version of unRaid that you are using, by default it will not display the application.
<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Display Random App Of The Day</b></font><br>
Enables/disables the displaying of random apps of the day when entering the Apps tab
<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Search bar is always in focus</b></font><br>
If the search bar is always in focus, at any point you can type in a search term and CA will search for it.  If the search bar is not always in focus, you will first have to click into the search bar to type.<br>
Setting this to "Automatic" enables this feature on computers, and disables it on mobile devices.<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Enable additional search results from dockerHub</b></font><br>
This option enables the plugin to perform additional searches from dockerHub when looking for an application.  See above (Advanced - dockerHub integration for more details) Default: No
<br>

<font color="red" size="3">Other Notes</font><br>
<br>
Community Applications (and its predecessor Community Repositories) introduced a number of additional XML tags in order to perform it's magic.  Any application / template author and/or maintainer should check out the list of schema additions here:  <a href='http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40299.0' target='_blank'>http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40299.0</a>
<br>
Depending upon which browser you are using, there may be a slight delay (~1-2 seconds) in displaying the results (in particular, All Applications using Table mode).  Some browsers are faster than others are sorting out all the displayed information.  In my testing, on a PC, Chrome is by far the fastest at rendering the results.  Note that generally whenever CA searches or re-renders the display, a spinning ring will appear.  <strong>When that ring stops spinning, CA has finished, and any delays from that point onwards are 100% entirely due to your browser</strong>
