<font color='purple' size='4'><center>Community Applications (Apps Tab) Module</center></font>
<font color="red" size="3"><p id='overview'>Overview</p></font>

Community Applications is a plugin designed to make finding, installing, and managing docker and plugin applications.  When using this plugin, there is no longer any need to use the <em>Repositories</em> section of the Docker Tab

From top to bottom will explain all aspects of Community Applications starting from the basic and going to the more advanced options.

All items within this plugin have tooltips enabled to further guide you in operation.  For a help for the settings for this plugin, load the settings page and press Help.  Each item will have associated help text displayed.

After installation, a new tab will appear on unRaid's main menu called "Apps".  Additionally, there will be a section within the Settings tab called Community Applications which has some extra utilities to customize the operation of this plugin.
<hr>
To begin with, at the top of the page are the navigation buttons.  Clicking or hovering over these buttons will change the displayed results accordingly:<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/SectionIcon.png' height='50px'> - This chooses which "section" to display (Available Apps, Installed Apps, Previously Installed Apps, Pinned Apps, additional CA Modules<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/ViewIcon.png' height='50px'> - This chooses how to display the results<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/CategoryIcon.png' height='50px'> - This selects a category of apps to display<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/SubCategoryIcon.png' height='50px'> - When available, this selects a subcategory of apps to display<br>


<hr>
<font size="3" color="red"><p id='displayed'>Displayed Results</p></font>

After selecting a category (or searching),the applications will appear: (example from Icon Details Mode)
<br><br>
<img src='https://github.com/Squidly271/ca.documentation/raw/master/icondetails.png'><br>
<br>
Clicking or hovering over the icon will bring up more details about the application.<br><br>
<img src='https://github.com/Squidly271/ca.documentation/raw/master/popup.png'><br>
<br>
The following action icons may be available for any given application:<br>
<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/install.png' height='25px'><img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/edit.png' height='25px'><img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/update.png' height='25px'> - These icons respectively will <b>Install, Edit, or Update</b> an application<br>
<img src='/plugins/community.applications/images/WebPage.png' height='25px'> - Clicking this icon will take you to an application's GUI<br>

<br>
<font size="3" color="red"><p id='searching'>Searching</p></font>
<br>
At the top right of the page is a search box.  Enter a search string here to search for either an application's name, author's name, repository name, or description<br><br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<font size='3' color='red'><p id='previous'>Installed / Previously Installed Applications</p></font>
<br>
Selecting Installed Apps from the "Section" icon will display all applications which are currently installed, and allow you to edit them.<br>
A <img src='https://github.com/limetech/webgui/raw/master/plugins/dynamix.docker.manager/images/remove.png' width='20px'></img> will appear next to the application.  Selecting this will allow you to uninstall the application, and optionally delete the appdata folder for the application (See <b>Settings</b> section)<br><br>
<br>
Selecting Previous Apps from the "Section" icon will display all applications which have been previously installed, and allow you to re-install them.<br>
A <img src='https://github.com/limetech/webgui/raw/master/plugins/dynamix.docker.manager/images/remove.png' width='20px'></img> will appear next to the application.  Selecting this will remove (ie: delete the user template) from the list of previously installed applications<br><br>
<hr>
<font size='3' color='red'><p id='pinned'>Pinning Applications</p></font>
<br>
On any of the displays (with the exception of when dockerHub search results are shown), you can "pin" an application for later viewing.  This is useful for when you're just skimming through the lists and come across an application that you'd like to try but don't have the time to do it right away.<br>
<br>
Pressing the <img src='https://github.com/Squidly271/community.applications/raw/master/source/community.applications/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/community.applications/images/redButton.png' style='height:20px;width:20px;'> will pin the application whereas pressing the <img src='https://github.com/Squidly271/community.applications/raw/master/source/community.applications/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/community.applications/images/greenButton.png' style='height:20px;width:20px'> will unpin the application.<br>
<br>
Pinned applications can be viewed by selecting Pinned Apps from the "Section" Icon<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<font size="3" color="red"><p id='dockerHub'>Advanced - dockerHub Integration</p></font>
<br>
<br>
There is a setting which you can enable which will allow you to search dockerHub for other applications beyond the ones which have had unRaid templates created for them.
<br>
When this option is enabled, a few more options are available.
<br>
<li>Clicking on the Application's Name of any application will then search dockerHub for that application.
<li>After performing any search for applications, a button will appear (<img src='https://github.com/Squidly271/community.applications/raw/master/source/community.applications/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/community.applications/images/docker.png' height=30px;>) to then allow you to search dockerHub for that application.
<br>
Within the dockerHub search results, you can navigate and search as before.  Clicking the author's name will search for all applications from that author.  Clicking the application's name will search for more results for that application name.
<br>
Clicking <input type='button' value='Add'> will attempt to create a template for that application and install it.  There are however some caveats with regards to the conversion process.  See this thread for more details: <a href='http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40262.msg401570#msg401570' target='_blank'>http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40262.msg401570#msg401570</a>
<br>
At a later time if you wish to manage the application added (Edit / restore to defaults, etc), the application will be available under the UNCATEGORIZED category.  (Alternatively, you could categorize the plugin by using the Docker Categorizer plugin <a href='http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40111.0'>HERE</a>
<br>
Depending upon what search term is currently being used, Community Applications may also offer you some alternate search terms for more relevant containers.
<br>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> When adding an application from dockerHub, popups must be enabled within your browser
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<font size="3" color="red"><p id='private'>Private Repositories</p></font>
<br>
If you have access to a so-called private repository (or wish to create your own), there are two options for integrating it into CA
<br>
Create a folder called <strong>/boot/config/plugins/community.applications/repositoryName</strong><br>
<br>
Within this folder, place any custom / private templates you might have.  (If using the dockerHub conversion section of this plugin, a folder will be automatically created here called <strong>dockerHub</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
The templates contained in the private repository will be flagged when displayed as <font color="red">Private</font>
<br>
<hr>
<font size="3" color="red"><p id='settings'>General Settings</p></font>
<br>
Within unRaid's Settings tab, there is a section called <em>Community Applications</em>.  A program called <em>General Settings</em> allows you to fine tune the operation of Community Applications as detailed below:
<br>
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Time to display applications as new / updated</b></font><br>
This option dictates the amount of time that a new or updated application will be flagged as new and displayed under the <strong>New / Updated</strong> category.  Defaults to 3 Months
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Favourite Repository</b></font><br>
This option allows you to set a "favourite" repository.  If set, then applications from that repository will display before all others.  Defaults to None
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Icon Size</b></font><br>
This option only applies to view modes Icons and Icon Details.  It sets the displaying of the icons to be either large or small (Defaults to Large)
<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Show already installed apps within available apps</b></font><br>
By default, if an application has been installed, it will not appear within the available apps  (It will only show within Installed Apps).  Selected this will display the installed apps within the available apps lists
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Open Add / Edit / Settings in new Tab</b></font><br>
This option determines whether or not a new tab will open when you add or edit or go to an app's settings.  Defaults to the same tab.
<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Hide Deprecated Applications</b></font><br>
By default, CA will not display any deprecated applications within the available apps.  It will always however show you any apps that have been deprecated within the Installed or Previous Apps sections.  As a general rule, it is not recommended to install deprecated applications onto your server
<font color="purple"><b>Hide Incompatible Applications</b></font><br>
If CA thinks that an application is incompatible with the version of unRaid that you are using, by default it will not display the application.
<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Display Random App Of The Day</b></font><br>
Enables/disables the displaying of 2 random apps of the day when entering the Apps tab
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Enable additional search results from dockerHub</b></font><br>
This option enables the plugin to perform additional searches from dockerHub when looking for an application.  See above (Advanced - dockerHub integration for more details) Default: No
<br>
<hr>
<font color='red' size='3'><p id='optionalModules'>Optional CA Modules</p></font><br>
<br>
By clicking on <input type='button' value='CA Modules'> within the Apps tab, a list of currently installed / available additional modules for CA will be detailed.  Some of these optional modules come already packed with CA (but can be uninstalled separately if so desired).  If an additional CA Module is not listed below, then it has its own dedicated Help files available within the app itself.
<br><br>
<hr>
<p id='autoupdate'></p><center><img src='https://github.com/Squidly271/ca.update.applications/raw/master/source/ca.update.applications/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/ca.update.applications/images/ca.update.applications.png' height='96px' width='96px'></center>
<font color='purple' size='4'><center>CA Auto Update Module</center></font>
<font color="red" size="3">Auto Update Settings</font><br><br>
Within the Community Applications section of <em>Settings</em> there is a program called "Auto Update Settings".  This module will allow your unRaid server to automatically update any or all of the plugin or docker applications currently installed to the latest versions as they become available without any user intervention.<br>
<br>
There are two separate sections within this module: Plugin Settings and Docker Settings.<br><br>
On both settings screens, you have the options to:<br>
<br> 
<font color='purple'><b>Send Notifications On Update</b></font><br> 
Defaults to Yes.  This will send a notification whenever an application has been updated<br>
<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Automatically update All Plugins|Dockers</b></font><br>
Defaults to No.  When set to yes, all applications for that section (plugins / dockers) will be automatically updated.  When set to No, a list of the currently installed applications will appear and you will have the option to individually set them to auto update or not.<br>
<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Update Frequency</b></font><br>
Set this to whatever time frame you want the module to check for (and install) the updates.  Available options are Disabled, Daily, Weekly, Monthly and custom.  When set to Daily/Weekly/Monthly, you should fill out appropriately the Hour, Minute, etc that the check will actually be performed at.  Setting this to "Custom" will allow you to manually enter a standard cron entry for when to perform the updates for greater flexibility (wikipedia: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron'>Cron</a>)<br>
<br>
Additionally, the plugin update settings also has this additional entry:<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Delay In Days Before Updating Applications</b></font><br>
Set this to the number of days after an application has been updated before autoupdating the application.  (Setting this to 0 will update the applications the same day they are released)  Defaults to 3 days. 
 <br>
<br><font color='red'><strong>Note:</strong></font> Community Applications will NOT automatically install any unRaid OS updates.
<br>
<p id='dockerAdvancedControl'></p><font color='red' size='3'><strong>Advanced Docker Control</strong></font><br>
Optionally, CA Auto Update supports running custom stop and start scripts for docker applications.  These scripts will be executed <em>prior</em> to stopping an application and <em>after</em> starting an application.<br><br>
To use this feature, create the following file(s) on your flash drive: (They are executed in order if they exist)<br><br><br>
<table>
<tr><td><b>/boot/config/plugins/ca.update.applications/scripts/stopping/stop_all</b></td><td>This script will be executed whenever <em>any</em> docker application is being updated (prior to updating)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/boot/config/plugins/ca.update.applications/scripts/stopping/{nameOfContainer}</b></td><td>This script will be executed whenever <em>{nameOfContainer}</em> is being updated (prior to updating)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/boot/config/plugins/ca.update.applications/scripts/starting/{nameOfContainer}</b></td><td>This script will be executed whenever <em>{nameOfContainer}</em> has been updated</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>/boot/config/plugins/ca.update.applications/scripts/starting/start_all</b></td><td>This script will be executed whenever <em>any</em> container has been updated</td></tr>

<font color='purple' size='4'><center>CA Appdata Backup/Restore Module</center></font>
<font color='red' size='3'>Backup Appdata Settings</font><br>
<br>
Within the Community Applications section of <em>Settings</em> there is a program called "Backup Appdata Settings".  This module will allow you to either manually or on a schedule backup your application's appdata folders from a cache-only share to the parity protected array.
<br>
The settings are as follows:
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Appdata Share (Source)</b></font><br>
This is the cache-only share where all of your docker appdata is stored (usually /mnt/cache/appdata).  Note that if your appdata folder is <em>not</em> listed here, then this module will not function for you.
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Save to Disk#</b></font><br>
This sets which disk on your array to save the backup to (see notes below)
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Destination Share</b></font><br>
This sets which share (and subfolder if chosen) to store the backup to (see notes below)
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Excluded Folders</b></font><br>
Use the excluded folder browser to select which folders within your appdata share to <em>not</em> include in the backup (ie: if you are also storing VM images within the appdata folder)
<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Backup USB Flash Drive</b></font><br>
This will backup up your USB flash drive.  Settings are (Same folder as appdata, separate folder, don't backup).  An additional file is automatically added to the config folder of the backup (and on the flash drive) called DISK ASSIGNMENTS.txt)  This contains all of the drive assignments (Parity, cache, disk1, etc) current as of the backup time.  /boot/config/super.dat is renamed just in case of a hardware change happening inbetween backups (ie: the parity disk at the backup was exchanged and the original placed into the array) which can cause data loss.<br>
Also, note that in the case of the destination being placed on the array (pretty much guaranteed in the case of same folder as appdata), then in the event of a complete flash failure, you cannot gain access to any of the backed up settings until you assign all of the disks back.  For the ultimate in protection, use the unassigned devices plugin and set the destination to be a SMB share from your desktop computer.
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Notification Settings</b></font><br>
This determines under what circumstances a notification (set up via Settings - Notification Settings) is sent:  (Disabled, Start And Stop, Completion Only, Errors Only)
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Path To Custom Stop / Start Script</b></font><br>
These two options allow you to run a custom script to run prior to the backup (and after the backup is completed) in order to perform any maintenance tasks, shut down plugins (if you want them backed up), etc
<br>
<font color='purple'><b>Update Applications On Restart</b></font><br>
Selecting Yes here will automatically install any available updates for the applications that are made available by the application template authors.  Note that this option <em>requires</em> CA Auto Update Applications to be installed
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Rsync Options</b></font><br>
This entry will allow you to add any custom options to the rsync command that the backup operation uses.  If you don't know what you're doing, don't touch this entry!
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Run Scripts in place of or in addition to</b></font><br>
Setting this to "in place of" effectively disabled the backup command, and allows the custom scripts to perform the actual backup.  Note that CA will still automatically stop and start the docker applications for you.
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Scheduled Backup Frequency</b></font><br>
Set these options to determine how often to run a scheduled backup operation (or include a custom CRON entry to manually make the schedule yourself)
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Put backups into separate dated subfolders?</b></font><br>
Setting this will create a separate folder (date and time) each time you run the backup.
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Delete backups after how many days?</b></font><br>
This is available when creating separate folders for each backup.  It will automatically delete backups that are older than the number of days you specify.  After a successful backup, then the old backups will be deleted.   In the event of a failed backup, no old backup sets will be deleted.
<br>
<font color="purple"><b>Attempt faster rsyncs?</b></font><br>
This option is available when creating separate foldersfor each backup.  When it is set to "no (default)", the backup (rsync) command will have to copy ALL of the files over.  If you set it to "yes", then prior to copying, one of the backups which are slated to be deleted will be renamed to be the same date and time as the backup that is about to run.  This will allow the rsync command to only have to copy the files which are changed over.  This can result in significantly faster backup times.  The downside is that in the event of the backup failing (for whatever reason), you will have lost the previously made backup.
<br>
NOTES:
<br>
<font size='3'><b>All files within your chosen destination folder will be deleted during a backup process</b></font>
<br>
When using unRaid 6.1.x, destinations have to be sent to a share <b>and</b> to a disk.  The reasons for this is due to hardlinks (which is a subject unto itself), but the net result is that the only way to guarantee a successful backup / restore is to send the backup to a disk share.
<br>Using 6.2+, destinations can be set to a user share (select <b>user</b> as the disk #), as 6.2 properly supports hardlinks on user shares.  The share you select however should be set to not use the cache drive however.
<br>
<hr>
<p id='restoreAppdata'></p>
<font color='red' size='3'>Restoring your appdata</font><br>
<br>
In the case of a cache drive failure, the steps required to restore your docker apps back to operational status is as follows:
<br>
<list>
<li>Replace the cache drive</li>
<li>Recreate the docker.img file via Settings - Docker Settings</li>
<li>Go to Settings - CA section - Backup/Restore</li>
<li>Select the restore tab</li>
<li>Verify the source and destination which appear and select a backup set to restore</li>
<li>After its finished, ideally you should also restart your server so that all changes made will take effect 100%</li>
</list>
<br>
The restore module will then copy the backup set back to your appdata share (and automatically set it to be cache-only).  Additionally, it will also delete any files which may have somehow been written to the array during the cache drive failure.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<p id='deleteAppdata'></p><center><img src='https://github.com/Squidly271/ca.cleanup.appdata/raw/master/source/ca.cleanup.appdata/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/ca.cleanup.appdata/images/ca.cleanup.appdata.png' height='96px' width='96px'></center>
<font color='purple' size='4'><center>CA Cleanup Appdata Module</center></font>

<font color='red' size='3'>Cleanup Appdata</font><br>
<br>
If you have been using docker for a while, and installing and uninstalling various applications, your appdata share probably has a bunch of old folders and files which are no longer needed, and hard to delete due to their permission settings.  The Cleanup Appdata modules (Settings -> Community Applications section) will determine which appdata folders (based upon your previously installed docker applications) are no longer needed and then prompt you to delete them.
This module will NOT touch any appdata folder which may be used for VMs, plugins, etc
<hr>
<p id='dockerAutostart'></p><center><img src='https://github.com/Squidly271/ca.docker.autostart/raw/master/source/ca.docker.autostart/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/ca.docker.autostart/images/ca.docker.autostart.png' height='96px' width='96px'></center>
<font color='purple' size='4'><center>Docker Autostart Manager Module</center></font><br>
<br>
The docker autostart manager module will extends the autostart abilities of docker applications.  Namely, you can specify the exact order in which applications start (ie: Start app "A" then app "C" then app "B") instead of unRaid starting A, B, C in order.  Additionally, you can also specify startup delays (in seconds) for each application.<br>
<br>
Access this module by going to the Docker Tab (Docker Autostart Manager section)<br>
<br>
<center><img src='http://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f109/squidaz/Untitled_zpsuxxpfolf.png' width='800px'></center>
<br>
Any of the apps listed on the left hand side will be managed by unRaid (and start all at once if the autostart is checked off).  Items on the right will be managed by this plugin.<br>
<br>
Click on any of the applications and then use the arrow buttons to move them from side to side (or up and down on the right pane), and enter in the appropriate startup delay.
<br><br>
Note that any of the applications that are managed by this module will appear on unRaid's standard docker tab as having "autostart" disabled.  This is normal.

<br>
Community Applications (and its predecessor Community Repositories) introduced a number of additional XML tags in order to perform it's magic.  Any application / template author and/or maintainer should check out the list of schema additions here:  <a href='http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40299.0' target='_blank'>http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40299.0</a>
<br>
Depending upon which browser you are using, there may be a slight delay (~1-2 seconds) in displaying the results (in particular, All Applications using Table mode).  Some browsers are faster than others are sorting out all the displayed information.  In my testing, on a PC, Chrome is by far the fastest at rendering the results.  Note that generally whenever CA searches or re-renders the display, a spinning ring will appear.  <strong>When that ring stops spinning, CA has finished, and any delays from that point onwards are 100% entirely due to your browser</strong>
